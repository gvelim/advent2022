# Day 16: Code

Below is an explanation of the code for Day 16's solution, which finds the optimal valve opening sequence to maximize pressure release.

## Code Structure

The solution for Day 16 is quite complex and uses several key components:

1. `ValveNet`: Represents the network of valves and tunnels
2. `Valve`: Represents a single valve with its flow rate
3. `ValveBacktrack`: Implements the backtracking algorithm to find optimal paths
4. `Cache`: Provides efficient caching of distances between valves

## Key Components

### Valve and ValveNet Structures

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../src/bin/day16.rs:232:242}}
```

The `Valve` struct represents a single valve with its flow rate and status. The `ValveNet` struct represents the entire network, using hashmaps to store the graph structure and valve information, along with a cache for distances.

### Valve Network Methods

The `ValveNet` implementation includes several key methods:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../src/bin/day16.rs:244:275}}
```

These methods set up the backtracking algorithm, build a cache of distances between valves, and identify the valves with non-zero flow rates.

### Backtracking Implementation

The core of the solution is the backtracking algorithm implemented in `ValveBacktrack`. For Part 2 (with an elephant), the implementation explores combinations of valve assignments:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../src/bin/day16.rs:54:140}}
```

This method recursively explores different combinations of valve assignments between the player and elephant, calculating the total pressure released for each combination.

### Distance Calculation

The solution calculates distances between valves using breadth-first search and caches the results for efficiency:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../src/bin/day16.rs:276:311}}
```

This function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path between valves, then caches the result to avoid redundant calculations.

### Main Function

The main function sets up and runs the solution:

```rust,no_run,noplayground
{{#include ../../../src/bin/day16.rs:20:41}}
```

The main function:
1. Parses the input to create the valve network
2. Identifies valves with non-zero flow rates
3. Builds a cache of distances between valves
4. Runs the backtracking algorithm for Part 2 (with an elephant)
5. Prints the maximum pressure that can be released and the optimal path

## Implementation Notes

- **Caching Strategy**: The solution uses extensive caching to avoid redundant calculations
- **Pruning**: The algorithm prunes paths that can't possibly lead to better solutions
- **Two-Actor Coordination**: The solution handles coordination between two actors (player and elephant) to avoid conflicting actions
- **Backtracking Approach**: The core algorithm uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore the solution space

The solution efficiently handles the complex optimization problem by focusing on the most relevant valves and using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
