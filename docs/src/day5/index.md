# Day 5: Supply Stacks

Day 5 involves rearranging stacks of crates following a series of move instructions.

## Problem Overview

The elves are loading supplies onto a cargo ship, and the crates need to be rearranged. Each crate is marked with a letter, and the crates are arranged in stacks. Your task is to:

1. Parse the initial arrangement of crates and the move instructions
2. Simulate the crate movement using two different crane models
3. Report which crates end up on top of each stack

This problem tests your ability to work with stacks, parse complex input formats, and implement different movement rules.
