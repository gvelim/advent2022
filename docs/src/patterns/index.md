# Patterns and Techniques

This section collects common patterns and techniques used across multiple Advent of Code solutions. These reusable approaches can help tackle similar problems in different contexts.

## Overview

Advent of Code challenges often rely on similar underlying algorithms and problem-solving approaches. Recognizing these patterns can make solving new puzzles easier and more efficient.

In this section, we explore:

- **Input Parsing**: Strategies for efficiently parsing different input formats
- **Grid-based Problems**: Techniques for navigating and manipulating 2D grids
- **Path Finding**: Algorithms for finding optimal paths through various spaces

Understanding these common patterns will not only help with Advent of Code challenges but also improve your general programming skills.
