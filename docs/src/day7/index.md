# Day 7: No Space Left On Device

Day 7 involves parsing terminal output to build a directory structure and calculate directory sizes.

## Problem Overview

You're trying to free up space on your device by analyzing the file system. Given a terminal output showing the commands you executed and their results, you need to:

1. Build a directory tree from the commands and output
2. Calculate the total size of each directory (including subdirectories)
3. Find directories smaller than a certain size
4. Find the smallest directory that, when deleted, would free enough space

This problem tests your ability to parse structured text, build a tree data structure, and perform size calculations on it.
