# Day 6: Tuning Trouble

Day 6 involves analyzing a datastream to find marker patterns of unique characters.

## Problem Overview

You're trying to tune a communication device, which requires finding markers in the datastream. A marker is a sequence of characters where all characters are different. Your task is to:

1. Find the position where the first start-of-packet marker (4 unique characters) appears
2. Find the position where the first start-of-message marker (14 unique characters) appears

This problem tests your ability to search for patterns in a stream of data and identify unique sequences of characters.
